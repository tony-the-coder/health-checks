This is the README file to get done with this course which is a good reminder but it is needed to get the Professional Certificate.
Once I am done with this whole certificate, I will fell much better about my skills.
It sure has been a long time since I used the command line and not the VS Code extension!
Now this is up in GitHub only right now
