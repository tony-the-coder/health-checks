Oh well if it does not oh well
This is the README file to get done with this course which is a good reminder but it is needed to get the Professional Certificate.
Once I am done with this whole certificate, I will fell much better about my skills.
It sure has been a long time since I used the command line and not the VS Code extension!
Now this is up in GitHub only right now
Lets see I am doing this at 730PM
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT no wait GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Well there is a change now but no conflict because it is not letting me commit because it knows about this change maybe I should not have done the update thing
Well, it worked I just forgot to open the file from the branch
<<<<<<< HEAD
I really want this to just work already

Will this cause the issue
=======
There was a conflict but it went away after I did a pull instead of saying the merge failed for some reason oh well I just need to move on.
